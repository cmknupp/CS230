Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Software Design Document for our client The Gaming Room.  The client requested assistance expanding their current Android application into a
web-based game capable of operating on multiple platforms. 
Requirements were: multiple platforms, including OS, Windows, Android and Linux. Unique player, team and game identifiers. One instance of each game in
memory at any time. Scalable to reach large user population.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I considered the differences in each platform and gave an overview of which would be the best fit for the requirements listed. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It helped to fully consider the implications of each platform, how it effects security, price, utility, etc. It changed my perspective on software
development, made it wider and more inclusive. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The executive summary and requirements/restraints felt redundant.  I would make it slightly more concise. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs guided the relationships between classes which really helps drive the code development process.  It also helped narrow the choices when 
considering which platform would be best to utilize for the application. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? I used the UML a ton when understanding how functions would need to flow. I suggested using a cloud-based Windows OS for the approach as I think it is most beneficial with respect to cost and utility.
